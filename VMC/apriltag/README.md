# AprilTag Module

### What does this module do?

The apriltag module is responsible for using the images pulled from the CSI camera to scan for visible [apriltags](https://april.eecs.umich.edu/software/apriltag).

A low-level C++ program captures the images and hands them off to the Jetson's GPU for processing and publishes the raw detections to the "vrc/apriltags/raw" topic.

From here, a second program, written in python subscribes to this topic, and upon new detections, uses linear algebra to perform a coordinate transformation in order to get several pieces of data. These detections include the tags ID, as well as the drone's absolute location in the court (pos_world), and the drones relative location to the tag itself (pos_rel).

This data is then broadcast out over MQTT for other modules, such as the fusion and sandbox modules to consume.

TODO UPDATE

- This module publishes the raw tag data to the **"vrc/apriltags/raw"** topic in the following format:

  - `id` - the id of the tag
  - `pos`
    - `x` - the position **in meters** of the camera relative to the **tag's x** frame
    - `y` - the position **in meters** of the camera relative to the **tag's y** frame
    - `z` - the position **in meters** of the camera relative to the **tag's z** frame
  - `rotation` - the 3x3 rotation matrix

  Sample Output:

```json

    {
        "id": 0,

- This module publishes the transformed tag data to the **"vrc/apriltags/visible_tags"** topic in the following format:

  - `id` - the id of the tag

  - `horizontal_dist` - the horizontal scalar distance from vehicle to tag, **in cm**

  - `vertical_dist` - the vertical scalar distance from vehicle to tag, **in cm**

  - `angle_to_tag` - the angle formed by the vector pointing from the vehicles body to the tag in world frame relative to world-north

  - `heading` -  the heading of the vehicle in world frame

  - `pos_rel` - the relative position of the vehicle to the tag in world frame **in cm**

    - `x` -  the x (+north/-south) position of the vehicle relative to the tag in world frame (for reference the mountain is **north** of the beach)
    - `y` - the y (+east/-west) position of the vehicle relative to the tag in world frame
    - `x` - the z (+down/-up) position of the vehicle relative to the tag in world frame (no, this is not a typo, up is really - )

  - `pos_world` - the position of the vehicle in world frame **in cm** (if the tag has no truth data, this will not be present in the output)

    - `x` - the x position of the vehicle relative to the world origin (this is the ship) in world frame (for reference the mountain is **north** of the beach)
    - `y` - the y position of the vehicle relative to the world origin in world frame
    - `z` - the z position of the vehicle relative to the world origin in world frame

    Sample output:

  ```json

  - This module publishes its best candidate for position feedback on the **"vrc/apriltags/selected"** topic in the following format:

    - `tag_id` - the id of the tag
    - `pos` - the position of the vehicle in world frame **in cm**
      - `n` - the +north position of the vehicle relative to the world origin in world frame
      - `e` - the +east position of the vehicle relative to the world origin in world frame
      - `d` - the +down position of the vehicle relative to the world origin in world frame
    - `heading` - the heading of the vehicle in world frame

    Sample Output:

    ```json
    {
