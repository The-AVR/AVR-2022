In this section we will upgrade the original landing gear from the VRC kit with a
set of 3D printed legs, as discussed in the [3D Printing]({{< relref "../../pre-requisites/3d-printing" >}}) section.
This upgrade will come in very handy during the competition phase and provided
much needed clearance beneath your VRC drone.

To install the 3D printed legs you will use the M3 screws and lock nuts provided
in the VRC kit. The photo below shows four M3 screws threaded through one of the
legs and placed onto the bottom motor plate.

Using needle nose pliers place a nut onto each of the screws.
Use your hex driver to securely screw the nut into the bolt.

Fasten tightly, but do not overtighten as you will run
the risk of cracking the 3D printed leg.

Repeat this process for all four legs and then reattach the top plate of the frame.
Be sure to revisit the Phase I GitBook for
[installing the top plate]({{< relref "../../../phase-i/primary-goal/vrc-drone-assembly/top-plate-and-arms" >}}) if you need a refresher. Your landing gear upgrade is now complete.
Look at how much space is now beneath your VRC drone!
