You'll need to login to your Jetson many times to setup and run software.
Out of the box, your Jetson will have a default user account called
`vrc` with a password of `bellvrc22`.

Here are 3 possible methods you can use.

## Monitor and Keyboard

Possibly the simplest way to connect to your Jetson is with
a monitor and keyboard. You'll just need a monitor that has HDMI or DisplayPort
that you can plug in to the Jetson.

Once at the desktop,
you can open a terminal by clicking the application launcher
in the bottom left (the 9 squares) or with the keyboard shortcut
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>t</kbd>.

## Serial

Another method of logging in to your Jetson is over a serial connection.
To do this, you'll need a serial client such as PuTTy.
Go to [this page](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
and download and install the `putty-64bit-<version>-installer.msi` file.

For Linux users, run

```bash
sudo apt install putty
sudo putty
```

Now, if you want to power the Jetson via USB (if the Jetson is not connected to
a wall adapter or a battery) remove the jumper behind the barrel jack.

Keep this somewhere safe, like sticking it to a piece of tape, it's very easy to lose!

Plug in a MicroUSB cable to the Jetson,

and then into your computer. Open up Device Manager,

and find out what COM port your Jetson is on.

![Look under Ports (COM & LPT). My Jetson enumerated as COM4](comport.PNG)

Open up PuTTy, choose the COM port you found above for the Serial line,
and put in `115200` as speed.

Click "Open". You should now see the Jetson's terminal.

This method can also be helpful if you've already configured the
Jetson to connect to a network, but don't know what the IP address is.

## SSH

This only works if you've already configured the operating system on the Jetson.
If you're setting up your Jetson from scratch, you'll need to use
a different method.

In the future, you'll want to use SSH to login to your Jetson,
as it is far more convenient. SSH is way to login to a Linux system
over a network. However, to do so, you'll need to know
the IP address of your Jetson. The simplest way to figure this out if
you don't know is to login via serial, and then run the command

```bash
ifconfig eth0
```

if you've connected the Jetson to ethernet or

```bash
ifconfig wlan0
```

if you've connected the Jetson to WiFi.

### `ssh` Command

The quickest way to login to yor Jetson over SSH, is to use the builtin `ssh` command
in Windows. Open up a command prompt or PowerShell, and run

```powershell
ssh <user>@<ip>
```

The first time you log in to your Jetson, you'll be prompted to accept
the host's key. Enter `yes`. You'll thenbe prompted for your password,
and then you'll be put into a terminal.

### PuTTy

If you're not comfortable with the command line, you can also use PuTTy to connect
over SSH. Select the "SSH" button in PuTTy, put in the hostname field `<user>@<ip>`
and then click the "Open" button.

You'll need to accept that you trust a key the first time.
