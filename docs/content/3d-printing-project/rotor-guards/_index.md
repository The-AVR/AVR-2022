While we definitely recommend you take on the 3D Design Challenge,
we understand that its not feasible for everyone. In that regard,
we've provided a set of rotor guards that can be 3D printed and assembled
with a few extra parts not shipped with your VRC Kit.

The STL files can be found
[here](https://github.com/bellflight/VRC-2022/tree/main/3DPrints/PropGuards).

In addition to the 3D prints, you'll need some extra hardware that can be
found on Amazon:
