As part of Phase 1 of the VRC, all members on the team will work together as a
group to conceptualize, design, fabricate, assemble, and test a
solution to address two needs

1. Create propeller guards to prevent the propellers from getting
   entangled in the side and upper nets of the flight arena enclosure.
2. Create an “LED Halo” that will serve as a signaling device in Phase 2 of
   this year’s Search & Rescue Challenge. The LED Halo is a custom-built
   bracket that houses the LED Strip.

The solutions for these needs do not necessarily have to be different physical
components. For example, the LED Halo might provide some elements of
protecting the propellers from entangling the upper net. Teams are
encouraged to be innovative in their approaches and document the
reasoning behind their choices.

The designs should be lightweight to minimize the impact on the
aircraft’s stability and endurance, yet strong enough to withstand
handling loads. Teams will be provided STL files of the following
as optional starting points for their designs:

1. Propeller guard mount that connects to the motor mount.
   Teams can use this as a possible connecting point to the airframe.

2. Vehicle Management Computer (VMC) mount. Teams can use the VMC mount as a
   possible connecting mount for the LED Halo or to be designed around.

All of the 3D files are
[available in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/bellflight/VRC-2022/tree/main/3DPrints/).

Although 3D printing is a great manufacturing capability,
_the components do not have to be 3D printed_.
Teams are welcome to use other manufacturing methods as
long as their design meets the requirements given below.

Design Requirements and Objectives:

1. The guard must prevent entanglement from all four sides and above the drone.
2. The lights on the LED Halo must be visible to an observer on the ground from all
   sides when the drone is on the ground and in flight.
3. Designs for Prop Guard and LED Halo must not encroach the given keep-out zone
   shown in blue below, which is defined by space occupied by the VMC mount assembly,
   whose parts are located
   [here](https://github.com/bellflight/VRC-2022/blob/main/3DPrints/JetsonNano/Jetson_Mount.STL)
   and [here](https://github.com/bellflight/VRC-2022/blob/main/3DPrints/JetsonNano/Jetson_Blocks.STL).
   The idea here is not so much of a design
   criteria, but just trying to make sure you don't design something that
   becomes an obstruction for Phase II.

Integrating your design with this mount is **allowed**, there are a couple
attach points on either side of the VMC mount for you to hook into.
As long as the VMC can fit into the mount and **any** cables that can be
connected to the VMC are unobstructed by your design, the design fits
the requirements for the keep out zone.
