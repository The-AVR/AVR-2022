title: "Senior Design Project"
weight: 2
---

When the Bell AVR team decided to divide the 2021 competition into
Phase 1 and Phase 2, it became clear that it would impact the seniors
who graduate after Phase 1 and miss the excitement of Phase 2.
The senior design project was created to highlight the seniors'
contributions in Phase 1 and give them an opportunity to shape and impact
their team's success in Phase 2.

The seniors on the team will be responsible for documenting and presenting
the design process that was used in the 3D Printing Project. It is this
documentation and presentation that will be judged as the Senior Design Project.

All the details, including the deliverables, judging, and prizes, can be found at
[REC](https://challenges.robotevents.com/challenge/144).
