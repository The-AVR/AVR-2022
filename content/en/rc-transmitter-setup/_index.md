## Setup

The FlySky FS-i6S RC transmitter is a highly configurable radio controller with a
touch screen, supporting up to 10 control channels at the same time.
In order to use it with the AVR drone, some setup is required, both for the
RC transmitter and for the FC. On this page, we will go into detail on how to
set up the RC transmitter so that it can be used to safely control the drone.

The radio controller box should include a quick start guide. A
more detailed user manual for the radio controller is available for download below.
