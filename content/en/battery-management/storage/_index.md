## Battery Storage

After using the battery, give it approximately 30 minutes to cool down.

Determine when the battery will be used going forward. If the battery will be used
again within 24 hours, proceed to fully charge the battery.
The goal is to minimize the time lithium batteries sit fully charged.
Long periods of maintaining full charge will dramatically reduce the lifespan
of the battery pack, and can lead to swelling/premature failure.

If the battery will not be used in the next 24-48 hours, please proceed with a
storage cycle, as demonstrated in the video below.

Storage charging may take hours to perform properly based on the
starting voltage of the pack. A storage cycle should never be conducted
without direct supervision. In cases where the time for a proper storage
cycle cannot be committed, leave the battery in a discharged state rather
than taking a chance and leaving it unattended while on the storage cycle.

The storage voltage range is typically between 3.70-3.85V per cell.
However, lower voltages, down to 3.4V per cell are unlikely to cause issues,
especially over shorter time periods. If the battery will be in storage for more
than a week, it’s best to perform a proper storage cycle as time permits.
