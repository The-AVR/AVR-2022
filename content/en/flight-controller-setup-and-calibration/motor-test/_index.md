title: "Motor Test"

One physical check that must be done to ensure your AVR drone hovers properly
is to verify that the motor positions and rotations are correct. We previously covered ESC wiring which should ensure that the FC output is going to the right motor.

We discussed motor rotation when installing the frame arms and learned that the rotation for each motor is important. You may recall the
image below and we will refer to it one more time before we run the motor test.

The video below will walk through the necessary steps to run the
position and rotation test.

It is not necessary to do this motor test every time you fly,
but it is highly recommended if any wiring modifications have been
made to your AVR drone.
