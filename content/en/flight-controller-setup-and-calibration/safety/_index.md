## Safety Setup

Previously, in the RC Transmitter Setup section, we covered
[Setting Up Failsafe]({{< relref "../../rc-transmitter-setup/setting-up-failsafe" >}}).
In QGC we need to make sure we disable some of the failsafe options, as many of
them are related to GPS-enabled drones. AVR is all about indoor navigation in a
GPS-denied environment therefore it warrants a different safety configuration.
The video below walks through the setup process.
