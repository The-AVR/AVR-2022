The AVR drone is 500mm in size and is represented by the diagonal
distance between motors. If you were to measure the distance it would be
close to 500mm. In QGC you will now configure the drone frame, which will
provide optimal settings for flight. Select **Airframe** in the navigation menu.

Scroll down in the **Airframe Setup** screen and look for **Quadrotor x**.
Click on the dropdown menu and select **S500 Generic** as the airframe type.
Scroll back up and click the **Apply and Restart** button in the top right of QGC.
You will be asked to confirm that you want to restart.
Click **Apply** and the airframe setting will be saved.

While the FC is rebooting QGC will disconnect for a few
moments and then automatically reconnect.
