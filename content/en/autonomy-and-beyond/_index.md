Teams are encouraged to learn and practice programming with their drone. While it is
**not mandatory**, programming the drone to perform tasks autonomously will give you an
edge in the competition.

This section will help you with:

- Installing and using VS Code to manage your project
- Installing and using Python
- Installing and working with git
- Using the Bell AVR sandbox environment
- Building and running your code with Docker
