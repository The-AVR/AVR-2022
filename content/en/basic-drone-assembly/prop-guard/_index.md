This section guides you through the assembly of the propeller guards

Warning: Do not use Loctite on any fasteners that are in contact with the polycarbonate prop guards.
Loctite is caustic to the material and will cause the prop guards to crack and ultimately fail. 

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}
Do not attempt to drill or machine carbon fiber motor arms.
Machining will create carbon dust which is very unhealthy to inhale.
Proper ventilation and respiratory equipment are required to machine carbon fiber components.

Notice: There are not enough M3 x 22mm bolts included in your kit to assemble the prop guards. Teams may choose from the list of solutions below, but are also encouraged to think of alternative solutions that are not listed.
 Purchase the remaining M3 x 22mm bolts (Recommended solution)
Pros: Quick fix, doesnâ€™t require any modifications to drone parts
Cons: Spend money and coordinate travel to store
Repurpose the M3 x 22mm bolts currently used on the upper landing gear mounts for mounting the prop guards. The M3 x 20mm Nylon bolts included in your kit will act as a substitute for the Aluminum bolts on the upper landing gear mount. 
Pros: Does not require purchase of additional supplies
Cons: Nylon hardware prone to breaking in substitute of Al on landing gear mounting brackets
Use Nylon M3 x 20mm bolts and nuts included in your kit to fasten prop guards to motor arms
Pros: Does not require purchase of additional supplies
Cons: Nylon hardware prone to loosening in a high vibration environment next to the motor. Loosening can be prevented by using a non-loctite thread locker applied to Nylon nuts and bolts.
Counterbore prop guard motor arm mounting holes to accommodate shorter length Aluminum fasteners included in your kit.
Pros: Does not require purchase of any additional supplies.
Cons: Run the risk of ruining prop guard components if done improperly. If this approach is attempted, a drill press and appropriately sized end mill are suggested to perform this operation. 




Locate the following items below in both your first and second kit shipments

The method you choose to pursue to secure prop guards to the motor arms will ultimately dictate which items you use in these assembly instructions. These instructions outline the assembly process when additional fasteners of correct length are purchased.

The clear polycarbonate prop guard pieces, short stand-offs (the pack of 4), long stand-offs (the multipack), and M3 x 15mm bolts (unlabeled bag) can be found in the second shipment.

The M3 x 22mm bolts and M3 Nuts can be found in the first shipment.

Fasten lower prop guard bracket to motor arm using agreed upon method.

Lower bracket fastened to motor arm


Taking the short stand-off, fasten it to the motor arm hole location closest to the base of the arm using the M3 x 15mm bolt in the unlabeled baggie.

Securing short stand-off

Taking the long stand-offs, fasten them to the 3 mounting locations on the lower prop guard bracket using the M3 x 15mm bolts.

Securing long stand-offs to lower bracket
















Your prop guard setup should now look like the picture below.

Stand-offs and lower bracket installed

Stack two of the upper prop guard brackets on top of one another, place a M3 x 15mm bolt through the two holes, and secure to one of the 4 stand-offs.

Securing upper brackets

Stack the remaining 2 upper brackets the same way as the step prior and secure it to the stand-off directly opposing the one used in the previous step.

Securing remaining upper brackets














Noting the correct overlap of the upper bracket pieces, secure the brackets to the remaining 2 stand-offs.

Assembled Prop Guard

Repeat these steps for the remaining three motor arms. Congrats, you have now properly assembled the prop guards to your AVR drone!
